## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

- v2.0 scope: Royal blue + black + white palette, Space Grotesk/Inter/JetBrains Mono fonts, static header, hamburger mobile, sidebar kept, minimal footer, load more pagination, 18-20px body text, dark mode equal priority
- v2.0 exclusions: No card grid (restyled list), no hero section, no featured posts, no newsletter, no category colors, no breadcrumbs (all deferred to v2.1+)
- Admin dark mode confirmed in scope (DARK-02)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Legacy content rendering: 20 years of WordPress HTML may break under new typography. Stress-test page needed in Phase 10.
- Response cache: Must clear after CSS deploys to avoid stale pages.
