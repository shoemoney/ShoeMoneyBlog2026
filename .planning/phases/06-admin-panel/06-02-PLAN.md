  <files>

    resources/views/components/admin/sidebar.blade.php
  </files>
  <action>
1. Create admin layout at resources/views/components/admin/layouts/app.blade.php:
   - Full HTML document with Tailwind via @vite
   - @livewireStyles in head, @livewireScripts before closing body
   - Two-column flex layout: sidebar (w-64) + main content (flex-1)
   - Include sidebar via x-admin.sidebar
   - Main area with white background, padding, and {{ $slot }}
   - Flash message display for success/error/info sessions

2. Create sidebar at resources/views/components/admin/sidebar.blade.php:
   - Dark background (bg-gray-800 text-white)
   - Site title/logo at top linking to frontend
   - Navigation links (ALL routes already exist from 06-01 as placeholders):
     - Dashboard (route: admin.dashboard)
     - Posts (route: admin.posts.index)
     - Comments (route: admin.comments.index)
     - Categories (route: admin.categories.index)
     - Tags (route: admin.tags.index)
     - Users (route: admin.users.index)
   - Active state highlighting using request()->routeIs()
   - Logout button at bottom (POST form to logout route)
   - Use wire:navigate for SPA-like navigation

NOTE: All admin.* routes were created as placeholders in 06-01. The sidebar can safely use route() helper for all navigation links. Placeholder routes redirect to dashboard with "coming soon" message until actual Livewire components are built.

Styling: Match the dark sidebar pattern from research. Keep it simple.

    grep -r "x-admin.sidebar" resources/views/components/admin/layouts/app.blade.php
  </verify>
  <done>
    - Admin layout exists with sidebar + main content areas
    - Sidebar has all navigation links with active states
    - Livewire styles/scripts included in layout

  <name>Task 2: Create Dashboard Livewire component and UPDATE existing route</name>
  <files>
    app/Livewire/Admin/Dashboard.php
    resources/views/livewire/admin/dashboard.blade.php
    routes/web.php
  </files>
  <action>
1. Create Dashboard component at app/Livewire/Admin/Dashboard.php:
   ```php
   <?php

   namespace App\Livewire\Admin;

   use App\Models\Comment;
   use App\Models\Post;
   use App\Models\User;
   use Livewire\Attributes\Layout;
   use Livewire\Attributes\Title;
   use Livewire\Component;

   #[Layout('components.admin.layouts.app')]
   #[Title('Dashboard')]
   class Dashboard extends Component
   {
       public function render()
       {
           return view('livewire.admin.dashboard', [
               'postCount' => Post::count(),
               'publishedCount' => Post::published()->count(),
               'draftCount' => Post::draft()->count(),
               'pendingComments' => Comment::pending()->count(),
               'userCount' => User::count(),
           ]);
       }
   }
   ```

2. Create dashboard view at resources/views/livewire/admin/dashboard.blade.php:
   - Welcome message with user name
   - Grid of stat cards (3 columns on large, 1 on mobile):
     - Total Posts (with published/draft breakdown)
     - Pending Comments (with link to moderation)
     - Total Users
   - Each card: white bg, shadow, rounded, icon, count, label
   - Use Tailwind utilities for styling

3. UPDATE routes/web.php admin group - REPLACE the dashboard placeholder:

   IMPORTANT: Do NOT create a new route group. The admin route group with middleware already exists from 06-01. Only UPDATE the dashboard route.

   Find this line in the existing admin route group:
   ```php
   Route::get('/', function () {
       return 'Admin Dashboard (placeholder - will be replaced by Livewire component)';
   })->name('admin.dashboard');
   ```

   Replace it with:
   ```php
   Route::get('/', \App\Livewire\Admin\Dashboard::class)->name('admin.dashboard');
   ```

   Leave all other placeholder routes (posts, comments, categories, tags, users) unchanged - they will be replaced by later plans.
  </action>
  <verify>
    php artisan livewire:list | grep Dashboard
    php artisan route:list --path=admin
    curl -I http://localhost:8000/admin (after login, should return 200)
  </verify>
  <done>
    - Dashboard component renders with stats
    - Existing placeholder route replaced with Livewire component
    - Stats show correct counts from database
    - All other placeholder routes remain intact for later plans
  </done>
</task>

</tasks>
