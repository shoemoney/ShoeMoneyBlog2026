# v2.0: UI Overhaul - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-01-29
**Status:** Ready for roadmap creation

## Milestone Boundary

Transform ShoeMoney from generic blog styling into a bold, distinctive brand identity. Covers colors, typography, layout, post cards, navigation, and admin panel visual refresh. No new features or capabilities — purely visual and UX improvements to existing functionality.

## Implementation Decisions

### Brand Identity & Color Palette
- White background, royal blue accent, black text — reversed for dark mode
- Blue derived from the existing ShoeMoney logo (Superman-style diamond shield with blue dollar sign "S")
- Single flat royal blue (deeper shade from logo), NOT gradient — gradient only on the logo itself
- Bold & loud energy — confident, in-your-face personality
- Personality expressed primarily through typography & layout, not micro-interactions
- Logo (shield + "ShoeMoney" text) in the site header
- Dark mode is equal priority — both modes designed simultaneously, not one as afterthought
- Logo file: `/Users/shoemoney/smlogos/shoemoneylogosm.png`

### Typography & Content Layout
- Modern geometric sans-serif for headings (e.g., Poppins, DM Sans)
- Large body text: 18-20px for readability
- Content width: 750-800px (Medium/Substack range)
- Generous whitespace — content breathes, premium editorial feel
- Code blocks: syntax highlighted with dark background, even in light mode

### Post Cards & Listings
- Card-based grid layout (2-3 columns) on homepage and archives
- Cards show: title + excerpt only — no meta clutter (no date, author, category on card)
- Featured images displayed on cards when available, clean fallback when not
- "Load more" button for pagination (not traditional page numbers, not infinite scroll)

### Navigation & Page Structure
- Static header (scrolls away with content, not sticky)
- Logo + "ShoeMoney" text in header
- Hamburger menu on mobile
- Two-column layout on desktop: content area + sidebar with widgets (keep current sidebar)
- Minimal footer — copyright + few links, stays out of the way

### Claude's Discretion
- Exact royal blue hex value (must have good contrast ratios for accessibility)
- Specific geometric font choice for headings
- Body font pairing
- Card shadow/border treatment
- Exact spacing scale values
- Admin panel visual refresh details (align with new brand)
- Mobile responsive breakpoints and card column counts
- Dark mode specific color adjustments beyond "reverse"
- Loading skeleton and empty state designs

</decisions>

## Specific Ideas

- Logo is a Superman-style diamond shield in black with a dollar sign "S" in gradient blue — the brand has superhero energy
- The deeper royal blue from the logo gradient should be the single flat accent color
- Bold personality comes through oversized headings and generous layout, not flashy animations
- 20+ years of content means many posts won't have featured images — card design must work cleanly without them
